# Tourism-System
A system that helps the user to create a trip that matches his preferences like budget, preferred places(natural, night, shopping, old), and preferred types of food (seafood, fine dining, etc).
The generated trip has the shortest possible path, this was implemented using Dijkstra's algorithm.
The system also has a recommender system that uses content-based filtering to recommend places to the user 
This was my graduation project from Damascus University's Department of Computer Engineering.
